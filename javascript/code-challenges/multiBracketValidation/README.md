## Challenge Description

This function accepts a string and returns a boolean. It will return true if any brackets present in the string and matched pairs. It will return false if any are not in balance.

## Approach & Efficiency

The solution for this problem involved turning the string into an array and checking each index for the presence of one of the six characters in question `(){}[]`. A count of each is kept to check for balance. If all balance in the end, then the function will return True otherwise False.
