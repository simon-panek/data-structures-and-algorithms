## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- `AddNode()`
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node

Big (O) Spac

- `AddEdge()`
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph

- `GetNodes()`
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

- `GetNeighbors()`
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

- `Size()`
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
