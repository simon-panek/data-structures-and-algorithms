# Graphs

## Authors: Simon Panek, Ricardo Barcenas, Stacy Burris

## Challenge

Develope a graph class with methods the following methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

- `AddNode()`
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node

Big (O) Space and Time = O(1)

- `AddEdge()`
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph

Big (O) Space and Time = O(1)

- `GetNodes()`
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

Big (O) Space and Time = O(n^2)

- `GetNeighbors()`
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

Big (O) Space and Time = O(n^2)

- `Size()`
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

Big (O) Space and Time = O(n^2)
