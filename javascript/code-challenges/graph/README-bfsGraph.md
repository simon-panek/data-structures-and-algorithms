# Challenge Summary

## Authors: Simon Panek, Lena Eivy

## Challenge Description

A method that returns the vertices of a graph in breadth first order.

## Approach & Efficiency

This solution uses a queue to keep track of which vertices' neighbors still need to be visited and a set to keep track of each unique vertices that is in the graph.

This solution has a Big (O) for time complexity of O(n^2) and for space complexity of O(n).
