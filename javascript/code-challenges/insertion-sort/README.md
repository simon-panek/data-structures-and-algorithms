## Challenge Description

Create a function that sorts and array in place from lowest to hightest value.

## Approach & Efficiency

As the algorithm loops through the array the lowest value is temporarily stored for each iteration and placed in the index position corresponding to its value order.

O(n) Time = O(n^2)
O(n) Space = O(1)
