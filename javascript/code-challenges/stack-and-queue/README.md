## API Approach & Efficiency

The following methods are available on the Stacks and Queues classes

- `push` *takes a value and adds it to the top of the stack with an efficiency of O(1)*
- `pop` *removes the top value from a stack and returns its value with an efficiency of O(1)*
- `peek` *returns the value of the top of the stack with and efficiency of O(1)*
- `isEmpty` *returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty with an efficiency of O(1)*
- `enqueue` *takes a value and adds it to the front of a queue with efficiency of O(1)*
- `dequeue` *removes a node from the front of a queue and returns the nodes value with an efficiency of O(1)*
- `isEmpty` *returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty with an efficiency of O(1)*
